Device Activity LED Trigger
==========================

This is a LED trigger useful for signaling an activity on a given
device identified by it's MKDEV(major, minor). A typical use case
would be debugging of a device or a driver on an embedded board,
patching up trivial electronic hardware design deficiencies in
software or just plain desire to indicate activity on a certain
device.

Internally, a instance of a trigger is created and registered with LED
triggers for every device added via ledtrig_dev_add() call. The
triggers are named in the following manner:

         `dev-<major>:<minor>`

And can be selected from under /sys/class/leds/*/trigger. A device
activity is explicitly indicated by calling ledtrig_dev_activity() for
a registered device.

The driver also creates a set of debugfs entries under
/sys/kernel/debug/ledtrig-dev, these are:

  devices - cat'ing will produce a list of currently registered
            devices

  register - echo'ing <major>:<minor> will create a trigger for this
             device (note, you still need to add at least
             ledtrig_dev_activity() hook)

  unregister - echo'ing <major>:<minor> will delete a trigger for this
               device

  trigger - echo'ing <major>:<minor> will fire the trigger for this
            device
